A popmedia control sequence can allow the malicious execution of executable file formats registered in the X desktop share MIME types (/usr/share/applications). The control sequence defers unknown file types to the handle_unknown_media() function, which executes xdg-open against the filename specified in the sequence. The use of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME type to be executed. An attacker can achieve remote code execution by introducing an executable file and a plain text file containing the control sequence through a fake software project (e.g., in Git or a tarball). When the control sequence is rendered (such as with cat), the executable file will be run.

417	CVE-2018-19983	330			2018-12-09	2019-10-03	6.1	None	Local Network	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	An issue was discovered on Sigma Design Z-Wave S0 through S2 devices. An attacker first prepares a Z-Wave frame-transmission program (e.g., Z-Wave PC Controller, OpenZWave, CC1110, etc.). Next, the attacker conducts a DoS attack against the Z-Wave S0 Security version product by continuously sending divided "Nonce Get (0x98 0x81)" frames. The reason for dividing the "Nonce Get" frame is that, in security version S0, when a node receives a "Nonce Get" frame, the node produces a random new nonce and sends it to the Src node of the received "Nonce Get" frame. After the nonce value is generated and transmitted, the node transitions to wait mode. At this time, when "Nonce Get" is received again, the node discards the previous nonce value and generates a random nonce again. Therefore, because the frame is encrypted with previous nonce value, the received normal frame cannot be decrypted.
418	CVE-2018-19982	295			2018-12-09	2019-02-06	2.9	None	Local Network	Medium	Not required	Partial	None	None	An issue was discovered on KT MC01507L Z-Wave S0 devices. It occurs because HPKP is not implemented. The communication architecture is APP > Server > Controller (HUB) > Node (products which are controlled by HUB). The prerequisite is that the attacker is on the same network as the target HUB, and can use IP Changer to change destination IP addresses (of all packets whose destination IP address is Server) to a proxy-server IP address. This allows sniffing of cleartext between Server and Controller. The cleartext command data is transmitted to Controller using the proxy server's fake certificate, and it is able to control each Node of the HUB. Also, by operating HUB in Z-Wave Pairing Mode, it is possible to obtain the Z-Wave network key.

Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). Using custom domains, it's possible to arrange things so that a Git repository is cloned to a folder named ".git" by using a vanity import path that ends with "/.git". If the Git repository root contains a "HEAD" file, a "config" file, an "objects" directory, a "refs" directory, with some work to ensure the proper ordering of operations, "go get -u" can be tricked into considering the parent directory as a repository root, and running Git commands on it. That will use the "config" file in the original Git repository root for its configuration, and if that config file contains malicious commands, they will execute on the system running "go get -u".

No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Sending a simple UDP packet to port 1900 allows an attacker to execute code on a remote device. However, this is only possible if the attacker is inside the LAN. Because of ASLR, the success rate is not 100% and leads instead to a DoS of the UPnP service. The remaining functionality of the Internet Box is not affected. A reboot of the Internet Box is necessary to attempt the exploit again.

Sending of specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface via PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) could cause a Denial-of-Service condition on affected devices. Flashing with a firmware image may be required to recover the CPU. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface or to be able to send messages via PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) to the device. No user interaction is required. If no access protection is configured, no privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the core functionality of the CPU, compromising the availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

This app component, when it receives a broadcast intent with a certain action string, will write a non-standard (i.e., not defined in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code) command to the /cache/recovery/command file to be executed in recovery mode. Once the device boots into recovery mode, it will crash, boot into recovery mode, and crash again. This crash loop will keep repeating, which makes the device unusable. There is no way to boot into an alternate mode once the crash loop starts.

In addition, the app initiating the factory reset does not require any permissions. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of a pre-installed platform app.

When an app sets the persist.service.logr.enable system property to a value of 1, an app with a package name of com.yulong.logredirect (versionCode=20160622, versionName=5.25_20160622_01) will start writing the system-wide logcat log, kernel log, and a tcpdump network traffic capture to external storage. Furthermore, on the Coolpad Canvas device, the com.android.phone app writes the destination phone number and body of the text message for outgoing text messages. A notification when logging can be avoided if the log is enabled after device startup and disabled prior to device shutdown by setting the system properties using the exported interface of the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app. Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can access the log files.

The com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.2) that contains an exported service named com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.MbnTestService that allows any app co-located on the device to provide key-value pairs to set certain system properties. Notably, system properties with the persist.* prefix can be set which will survive a reboot. On the Vivo V7 device, when the persist.sys.input.log property is set to have a value of yes, the user's screen touches be written to the logcat log by the InputDispatcher for all apps. The system-wide logcat log can be obtained from external storage via a different known vulnerability on the device. The READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary to access the log files containing the user's touch coordinates. With some effort, the user's touch coordinates can be mapped to key presses on a keyboard.

When logging is enabled, there is a notification in the status bar, so it is not completely transparent to the user. The user can cancel the logging, but it can be re-enabled since the app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest cannot be disabled. The writing of these logs can be initiated by an app co-located on the device, although the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary to for an app to access the log files.

Using the exported interface of the com.android.modem.service app, any app can enable and obtain certain log files (modem and logcat) without the appropriate corresponding access permissions. The modem logs contain the phone number and full text body of incoming and outgoing text messages in binary format. In addition, the modem log contains the phone numbers for both incoming and outgoing phone calls. The system-wide logcat logs (those obtained via the logcat binary) tend to contain sensitive user data. Third-party apps are prevented from directly reading the system-wide logcat logs. The capability to read from the system-wide logcat logs is only available to pre-installed system apps and platform apps. The modem log and/or logcat log, once activated, get written to external storage (SD card). An app aware of this vulnerability can enable the logs, parse them for relevant data, and exfiltrate them from the device. The modem log and logcat log are inactive by default, but a third-party app with no permissions can activate them, although the app will need to be granted the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to access them.

The vulnerable component named com.android.server.SystemRestoreReceiver will write a value of --restore_system\n--locale=<localeto the /cache/recovery/command file and boot into recovery mode. During this process, it appears that when booting into recovery mode, the system partition gets formatted or modified and will be unable to boot properly thereafter. After the device wouldn't boot properly, a factory reset of the device in recovery mode does not regain properly functionality of the device. The com.android.server.SystemRestoreReceiver broadcast receiver app component is accessible to any app co-located on the device and does not require any permission to access. The user can most likely recover the device by flashing clean firmware images placed on an SD card.

The dynamic-registration of the MasterClearReceiver broadcast receiver app component is not protected with the android.permission.MASTER_CLEAR permission during registration, so any app co-located on the device, even those without any permissions, can programmatically initiate a factory reset of the device. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of core Android process.

Any app co-located on the device can read the most recent text message from each conversation. That is, for each phone number where the user has either sent or received a text message from, a zero-permission third-party app can obtain the body of the text message, phone number, name of the contact (if it exists), and a timestamp for the most recent text message of each conversation. As the querying of the vulnerable content provider app component can be performed silently in the background, a malicious app can continuously monitor the content provider to see if the current message in each conversation has changed to obtain new text messages.
