53	CVE-2019-1002101	59			2019-04-01	2020-02-10	5.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	Partial	The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the user’s machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the user’s machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links. The issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.

An attacker can create a fake camera server that listens for the client looking for a camera on the local network. When the camera responds to the client, it responds via the broadcast address, giving all information necessary to impersonate the camera. The attacker then floods the client with responses, causing the original camera to be denied service from the client, and thus causing the client to then communicate exclusively with the attacker's fake camera server. When connecting to the fake camera server, the client sends all details necessary to login to the camera (username and password).

Configuration files used by gRPC were found to contain hardcoded credentials that could be used by the Junos Network Agent to perform unauthorized read of certain non-critical information (e.g. sensor data). Additionally, APIs exposed via the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) may be able to perform non-critical 'set' operations on the device. These APIs need the client to be authenticated for which the username/password can be used. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can only occur if the Junos Network Agent package (Junos Telemetry Interface) is installed on the device. If the Junos Network Agent is not installed, then the gRPC interface required to leverage these credentials is unavailable and the system is not vulnerable to this issue.

Additionally, some clients which were previously holding IPv6 addresses will not have their IPv6 Identity Association (IA) address and network tables agreed upon by the jdhcpd daemon after the failover event occurs, which leads to more than one interface, and multiple IP addresses, being denied on the client. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.
1052	CVE-2019-0028			DoS	2019-04-10	2022-01-24	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	On Junos devices with the BGP graceful restart helper mode enabled or the BGP graceful restart mechanism enabled, a BGP session restart on a remote peer that has the graceful restart mechanism enabled may cause the local routing protocol daemon (RPD) process to crash and restart. By simulating a specific BGP session restart, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing prolonged denial of service (DoS). Graceful restart helper mode for BGP is enabled by default. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D48; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S8; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S7, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R3; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D92, 17.2X75-D102, 17.2X75-D110; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S2, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S4, 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.

The Vision system relies on the client binary to enforce security rules and integrity of SQL statements and other content being sent to the server. Client HTTP calls can be manipulated by one of several means to execute arbitrary SQL statements (similar to SQLi) or possibly have unspecified other impact via this custom protocol. To perform these attacks an authenticated session is first required. In some cases client calls are obfuscated by encryption, which can be bypassed due to hard-coded keys and an insecure key rotation protocol. Impacts may include remote code execution in some deployments; however, the vendor states that this cannot occur when the installation documentation is heeded.

In addition, the app initiating the factory reset does not require any permissions. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of a pre-installed platform app.

This app contains an exported service named com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService that will record the screen for 60 minutes and write the mp4 file to a location of the user's choosing. Normally, a recording notification will be visible to the user, but we discovered an approach to make it mostly transparent to the user by quickly removing a notification and floating icon. The user can see a floating icon and notification appear and disappear quickly due to quickly stopping and restarting the service with different parameters that do not interfere with the ongoing screen recording. The screen recording lasts for 60 minutes and can be written directly to the attacking app's private directory.

The system_server process in the core Android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage. The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND_STATUS_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device.
1168	CVE-2018-14996			Exec Code	2019-04-25	2019-10-03	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The Oppo F5 Android device with a build fingerprint of OPPO/CPH1723/CPH1723:7.1.1/N6F26Q/1513597833:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.dropboxchmod (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) that contains an exported service named com.dropboxchmod.DropboxChmodService that allows any app co-located on the device to supply arbitrary commands to be executed as the system user. This app cannot be disabled by the user and the attack can be performed by a zero-permission app. Executing commands as system user can allow a third-party app to video record the user's screen, factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and obtains the user's text messages, and more. This vulnerability can also be used to secretly record audio of the user without their awareness on the Oppo F5 device. The pre-installed com.oppo.engineermode app (versionCode=25, versionName=V1.01) has an exported activity that can be started to initiate a recording and quickly dismissed. The activity can be started in a way that the user will not be able to see the app in the recent apps list. The resulting audio amr file can be copied from a location on internal storage using the arbitrary command execution as system user vulnerability. Executing commands as system user can allow a third-party app to factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), change the default Input Method Editor (IME) (e.g., keyboard) with one contained within the attacking app that contains keylogging functionality, obtain the user's text messages, and more.
