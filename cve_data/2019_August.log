203	CVE-2019-15239	416			2019-08-20	2020-08-18	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before 4.14.139.

Webmin 1.890, in a default installation, contains a backdoor that allows an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute commands. This CVE only refers to the backdoor that was enabled by default, and therefore is a separate CVE from CVE-2019-15107. NOTE: although the vendor's build infrastructure was compromised in 2018, the compromise is not known to affect any GitHub repository. Thus, the relatively uncommon case of an end user building their own copy of Webmin (from the 1.890 tag on GitHub) is thought to be safe.

Protection was added, to address CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed. However this new protection could be bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url describing the script location is correctly encoded before further processing. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.

The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU.

The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.

The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory.

The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

An information disclosure vulnerability in the WebFTP mode allows a malicious user to obtain plaintext authentication credentials for a remote FTP server from the ASG/ProxySG's web listing of the FTP server. Affected versions: ASG 6.6 and 6.7 prior to 6.7.4.2; ProxySG 6.5 prior to 6.5.10.15, 6.6, and 6.7 prior to 6.7.4.2.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WebFTP mode allows a remote attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code in ASG/ProxySG's web listing of a remote FTP server. Exploiting the vulnerability requires the attacker to be able to upload crafted files to the remote FTP server. Affected versions: ASG 6.6 and 6.7 prior to 6.7.4.2; ProxySG 6.5 prior to 6.5.10.15, 6.6, and 6.7 prior to 6.7.4.2.

The eXecute-Only-Memory (XOM) implementation prevents code read-outs on protected memory by generating bus faults. However, single-stepping and using breakpoints is allowed in XOM-protected flash memory. As a consequence, it is possible to execute single instructions with arbitrary system states (e.g., registers, status flags, and SRAM content) and observe the state changes produced by the unknown instruction. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing protected and unknown instructions with specific system states and observing the state changes. Based on the gathered information, it is possible to reverse-engineer the executed instructions. The processor acts as a kind of "instruction oracle."

This occurs because sk_type and protocol are not checked in the appropriate part of the ip6_mroute_* functions. NOTE: this affects Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.187.
